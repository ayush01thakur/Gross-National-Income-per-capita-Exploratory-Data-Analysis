**Project Overview**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process. In this project, I have performed Data cleaning and optimization by arranging the data and managing the null values. Furthermore, I have performed the EDA on the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita dataset. The aim is to uncover insights, relationships, and anomalies within the data with the help of the graphs and plots. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of the GNI per capita trends.


**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains data from 1990 to 2021 GNI per capita data from all 195 countries. The data is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/gross-national-income-per-capita. The dataset includes variables such as year, country, GNI per capita, and potentially other relevant socio-economic indicators.


**Notebooks**

The project is organized into Jupyter Notebooks, each serving a specific purpose:

_Data Collection and Cleaning_: This notebook focuses on fetching the dataset from the source and performing necessary data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation.

_Exploratory Data Analysis_: In this notebook, the cleaned data is thoroughly analyzed using descriptive statistics and visualizations. Trends, distributions, correlations, and outliers are explored to derive meaningful insights.


**Libraries used**

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
